## Elm

This project is (so far) written with Elm.

Elm can be insalled by following instructions on [here](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html).

## Running

The best way to run specific days is to use the `elm reactor` command, then navigating to the day you want to run. Clicking on the `Main.elm` file will compile and run the code, displaying any output in the browser.
